			Composting, in a lot of ways, is essential in creating an overall better environment. It helps us become self-sufficient and responsible members of our own communities. With composting, we lessen the amount of food waste we throw out irresponsibly, which in result lessens potential risks of toxic leachates which contaminate our groundwater. Water contamination by landfill leachates can cause health conditions such as allergies, stomach disorders, blood disorders, renal failure, seizures, birth defects and even cancer.
			</p>
			
			&nbsp
			
			<p align="justify">
			In an even broader picture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that each year, U.S. food loss and waste embodies 170 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (million MTCO2e) GHG emissions (excluding landfill emissions) – equal to the annual CO2 emissions of 42 coal-fired power plants (Buzby, 2022).
			</p>
			
			&nbsp
			
			<p align="justify">
			Climate changes will worsen if greenhouse gas emissions of this scale continue. The loss of sea ice, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, rise in sea level, and more extreme heat waves are already occurring as a result of the consequences experts projected. All these problems are man-made therefore it is up to us to change for the better. Learning to compost with different materials and doing it properly helps us lessen our damage to the atmosphere in our own little way.

			<span>Composting</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">

			In a study by Cooperland, L. (2002), composting was defined as controlled decomposition, which is how organic waste naturally decomposes. Composting converts unprocessed organic waste into humic compounds that are biologically stable and provide great soil additions. Manure and other raw organic materials are more difficult to manage than compost, which also holds well and has no odor.

			<span>Food Waste and Climate Change</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">
			Enormous quantities of food waste (FW) is becoming a global issue. Sustainable treatments using green technology are crucial to solving this ongoing issue (Dahiya et al., 2018). Composting has grown in importance for solid waste disposal since it is an effective and environmentally beneficial way to minimize waste volume. Composting may also detoxify toxic organic compounds and pathogens while producing a valuable agricultural resource (Jun Song & Greenway, 2004). Compost aids in the fight against climate change in a number of ways, such as by lowering landfill emissions of greenhouse gasses, encouraging plants to absorb carbon dioxide, and strengthening the resistance of our projects and gardens to the impacts of climate change.

			<span>Compost Chemistry and Microbiology</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">
			Compost affects microorganisms mainly by affecting nutrient, oxygen and water supply. Harmful microorganisms are mainly inactivated by high temperatures, but other mechanisms of inactivation have also been demonstrated,  e.g. certain plant-derived compounds and antagonistic interactions. Application of compost increases the microbial activity of soils, and crops are less sensitive to diseases after compost application (disease suppressiveness) (Fuchs, 2010). Volatile organic acids (VOA) are crucial because they indicate the temporal microbiological features of active and cured compost, which influence the compost's propensity to become odorous and phytotoxic (Brinton, 1998). Better information in this field would undoubtedly allow us to improve the overall quality of the compost we'll produce.

			<span>Tomato Plant</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">			
			"Like many herbaceous plants, tomatoes need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, along with other trace minerals to grow and fruit successfully," says gardener and tomato growing expert Emma Biggs.
			</p>
			
			&nbsp
			
			<p align="justify">
			Tomato plants require three essential nutrients from fertilizer: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as trace minerals. Most fertilizers contain a blend of these three components; the percentage of each will be indicated on the box. For example, if the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium ratios are equal, the fertilizer may be labeled as 10-10-10; if more nitrogen is present, the fertilizer may be labeled as 15-10-10. (Buiano, 2021).

			<span>Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide</span>

			In a study conducted by Cohen et al. (2019), their results showed that N interacting with CO2 levels influences root system development with respect to length, anatomy and distribution of N concentration between roots and shoots. They proposed that the response of tomato roots to increased CO2 depends on the N fertilization rate and that the reduction in xylem size may be the underlying response limiting nitrogen allocation from roots to shoots. In addition, the higher abundance of amino acids in roots indicates increased nitrogen metabolism in roots under N-rich eCO2 conditions.

			<span>Potassium</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">		
			Potassium (K) is an essential macronutrient for plants involved in many physiological processes. It is also necessary for human nutrition, so it is important not only for crop yield, but also for the quality of the edible parts of plants. Although K is not incorporated into organic matter, K deficiency has strong effects on plant metabolism. Plant responses to low K include changes in the levels of many metabolites, changes in the transcription levels of many genes, and changes in the activities of many enzymes. (Amtmann & Rubio, 2012b)

			<p align="justify">
			<span>Phosphorus</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">	
			Phosphorus (P) is a critical macronutrient that plays an important role in plant growth and plant metabolism. Soil P usually limits plant growth due to its poor mobility. Currently, overcoming P deficiency and increasing soil P availability is a necessary issue for achieving high crop productivity, highlighting the need to apply large amounts of inorganic P fertilizers in agricultural ecosystems (Higo et al., 2020).	
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">		
			Soil P is known as an important nutrient for tomato production and other crops such as maize and soybean. Maintaining adequate soil phosphorus levels is critical for maximizing tomato growth and development.

			<span>Cabbage and Eggshells</span>
			</p>
			
			<p align="justify">
			Based on a webpage done by the Busch System Resource Center (2016), it can be found that high acidity can actually kill the good bacteria that helps break down the material in a compost pile. The compost material we’ll use (cabbage and eggshells) are low in acid-levels and have nutrients that make our compost of better quality, cabbage having a pH level ranging between  5.50-6.75 and eggshells containing calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Adding eggshells in your compost helps the soil and prevent blossom end rot (a water-soaked spot at the blossom end of tomato fruits).
